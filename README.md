# awesome-forth-implementations

A list of forth implementations I find and think are interesting in some way. This list is curated to my very subjective tastes for now but feel free to submit PRs.

Here I will provide github links which are maybe easier to navigate.

- [factor](https://github.com/factor/factor): a concatenative, stack-based programming language with high-level features including dynamic types, extensible syntax, macros, and garbage collection.
- [gforth (mirror)](https://github.com/forthy42/gforth): Gforth is a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth/Forth 200x language (original on [savannah](https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gforth/))
- [colorForth](https://github.com/narke/colorForth): A dialect of Forth that uses color to replace punctuation. Includes its own operating system. Produces extremely compact programs. Instant compile from pre-parsed source. [Source forge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/colorforth/)
- [r34d](https://github.com/phreda4/r3d4): Similar to colorForth but with prefixes instead of colors.
- [rainbowforth](https://github.com/flagxor/rainbowforth): An implementation of colorforth.
- [firmforth](https://github.com/anse1/firmforth): A JIT forth that uses libfirm, a library for optimization, to gain some speed.
- [neos](https://github.com/i42output/neos): a cross-platform language agnostic scripting engine with a custom bytecode JIT.
- [bigforth](https://github.com/forthy42/bigforth): bigFORTH is a fast x86 implementation of the ANS Forth language
- [if.x86](https://github.com/jeffmd/if.x86): A hybrid stack plus register based programming language.
- [b1fipl](https://github.com/marcpaq/b1fipl): Some short implementations of forths can be found here
- XY: a family of array-oriented, concatenative programming languages with first-class continuations. XY 1 has quotations, lists, functions, and patterns. XY 2 is flat. XY 0 has quotations and shuffle-symbols but dispenses with lists and patterns. (I don't know where to find an implementation only a [document](http://www.nsl.com/k/xy/xy.htm))
- [Kitten](https://github.com/evincarofautumn/kitten): a statically typed, stack-based functional programming language designed for simplicity, speed, and safety. 
- [Stabel (alpha)](https://stabel-lang.org/): RPN + static type system, compiles to WebAssembly. Not a forth per se, but may offer some ideas or be of some use.
